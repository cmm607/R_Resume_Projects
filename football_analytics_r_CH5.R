#Question 1.Repeat the analysis without qb_hit as one of the features. How does it change the leader board?

#As can be seen below, the biggest thing I see is that QBs like Matt Ryan who had not as good offensive line play 
# fall lower down the list when not accounting for QB hits as they have worse play due to that fact, but it is not
#being taken into consideration.

#Question 2. What other features could be added to the logistic regression model?
#A lot could be added. Specifically I think the time it takes the QB to release the ball should be taken into 
#account and the current personnel that is on the field should be taken into consideration.
